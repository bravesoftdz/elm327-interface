# elm327-interface
Some basic interface for the ELM327 BT OBD2 Protocol.

# Features
* Attempts to abstract the protocol handling of ELM327, which can be a bit crappy sometimes. 
* No need to deal with string protocol, which is always a plus
* I don't expect anybody to actually use it, but maybe it can serve as an example.

# Notes
It's missing some classes, but I don't want to publish that. Just comment out whatever is missing, it is not vital to the actual operation.
